a) Output: Woof, woof, woof!
   Reasoning: Creates an object of the dog class and runs the method 'call'. This runs a for loop that prints 'woof' then loops 3 times and adds an '!' at the end.
   Using: Overloading

b) Output: I'm a cat, go away!
   Reasoning: Uses the 'toString' method from cat to print above.
   Using: Polymorphism / Overriding

c) Output: Error.
   Reasoning: Object being created doesn't have the method 'call'.
   Using: N/A

d) Output: Pet@15db9742
   Reasoning: Method from object is called, printing its address.
   Using: Polymorphism

e) Output: woof!
   Reasoning: Creates object which uses 'Dog' class method 'call' to print statement.
   Using: Polymorphism

f) Output: Come here, kitty? ... Don't waste my time.
   Reasoning: Creates object using 'Cat' class and runs the 'toString' method with a passed string value. The method returns the combination which is then printed.
   Using: Overloading

g) Output: Error.
   Reasoning: Creates object using 'Cat' class and runs the 'call' method while passing an integer. An error is printed because the method used doesn't accept any parameters.
   Using: N/A

h) Output: four
   Reasoning: Creates object using 'Dog' class and runs the 'feet' method from the 'Pet' class that it extends from. The method returns a string which is printed.
   Using: Polymorphism

i) Output: Error.
   Reasoning: Creates object and calls 'call' method with a passed integer value. An error is printed because the method doesn't accept any parameters/exist.
   Using: N/A
