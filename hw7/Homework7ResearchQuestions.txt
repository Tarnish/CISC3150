Question 1: If you were to throw a checked exception the code would fail to compile.
It doesn't fail to compile as written because it's an unchecked exception which
doesn't display a compilation error since it isn't checked at compile time.

Question 2:
You're able to call the default implementation of a method in an interface
with that syntax because you are calling the interface method with super().
You are invoking the super method which runs a chain up and overrides, causing
the print message to display.
